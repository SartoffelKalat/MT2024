The newly developed feature set allows two users to edit and create objects for a room in their preferred view through SharePlay. Via WebRTC, participants can furthermore request the host's screen as a video stream. While the resulting architecture works well within local networks and provides a solid basis for future work, issues manifest once one participant is joining remotely. This paper provides an in-depth evaluation of possible solutions to the above-mentioned stability issues.},

	abstract = {Reducing end-to-end streaming latency is critical to HTTP-based live video streaming. There are currently two technologies in this domain: Low-Latency HTTP Live Streaming (LL-HLS) and Low-Latency Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (LL-DASH). Many players support LL-HLS and/or LL-DASH protocols, including Apple's AVPlayer, Shaka player, HLS.js Dash.js, and others. This paper is dedicated to the analysis of the performance of low-latency players and streaming protocols. The evaluation is based on a series of live streaming experiments, repeated using identical video content, encoders, encoding profiles, and network conditions, emulated by using traces of real-world networks. Several performance metrics, such as average stream bitrate, the amounts of downloaded media data, streaming latency, as well as buffering and stream switching statistics are captured and reported in our experiments. These results are subsequently used to describe the observed differences in the performance of LL-HLS and LL-DASH-based players.},
